# League-of-Legends-Win-Prediction

I did a machine learning project related to the League of Legends, a very comman MOBA game, which greatly affects my mental performance. In this project, the dataset we downloaded from Kaggle includes data from approximately 5500 matches. This data includes data such as which champions were taken during the match, which champions were banned, who took the first tower, who shed the first blood, which team took the first dragon. First, we cleaned this data. Then, we made the data usable for our model with the One Hot Encoding method. We obtained different sports using the random forest classifier model, and we tried to predict with the machine learning model which champion we take while playing any match from these different scores.
